## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A laser diode continuously shines a beam onto the LDR.
2. As long as the beam is uninterrupted, the LDR keeps the circuit inactive.
3. When an object (e.g., a person) breaks the beam, the LDR's resistance increases.
4. This change activates the transistor, triggering the buzzer.
5. Once the beam is restored, the system resets.

Basic Description:
- LDR + 10kΩ resistor form a voltage divider.
- Output of divider goes to the base of an NPN transistor.
- Transistor switches on the buzzer connected to the collector.

## 🔌 Assembly Instructions

1. Place the LDR on one end of your setup.
2. Aim and fix the laser module directly at the LDR.
3. Assemble the voltage divider circuit.
4. Connect the transistor and buzzer as per the circuit diagram.
5. Power the circuit using a 9V battery.
6. Test by breaking the laser beam — the buzzer should activate.

## 🧪 Testing & Usage

- Align the laser accurately with the LDR.
- Use in doorways, windows, or corridors.
- Test system sensitivity by gradually blocking the beam.
- For wider areas, use mirrors to redirect the laser path.

## 🚀 Possible Upgrades

- 🔌 **Arduino Integration:** Send SMS or push notifications.
- 🧠 **Microcontroller Logging:** Record timestamps of intrusions.
- 📡 **Wireless Module:** Remote monitoring via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
- 🎯 **Multi-Beam System:** Cover more areas with multiple lasers.

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- Never point the laser at eyes.
- Ensure stable mounting to avoid misalignment.
- Use resistors to protect components from overcurrent.
